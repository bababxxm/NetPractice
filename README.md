# NetPractice

This project has been created as part of the 42 curriculum by sklaokli.

## Description

NetPractice is a 42 school project designed to provide a foundational understanding of computer networking. The project consists of a series of networking puzzles of increasing difficulty. The primary goal is to configure small-scale networks by assigning IP addresses, defining subnet masks, and setting up routing tables to ensure all nodes in the network can communicate successfully.

This project serves as a practical introduction to how data moves across local and global networks, emphasizing the logic behind addressing and routing.

## Instructions

Running the Training Interface
To work on the project levels, follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine.

Locate the index.html file within the project directory.

Open index.html in any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari).

Solve the networking puzzles provided in the interface.

## Exporting Configurations

Once you solve a level:

Click the Export button within the training interface.

This will generate a configuration file for that specific level.

Save these files; you will need them for the final submission.

Submission Requirements
To successfully pass the project:

You must export the configuration files for all 10 levels.

All 10 exported configuration files must be placed at the root of your Git repository.

Ensure the filenames follow the default naming convention provided by the interface (e.g., level_1.conf, level_2.conf, etc.).

## Resources

This project required a deep dive into the following fundamental networking topics:

### TCP/IP Addressing

Managing IPv4 address allocation and identifying network vs. host portions.

### Subnet Mask

Using CIDR notation and decimal masks to define the size and boundaries of a sub-network.

### Default Gateway

Configuring the "exit point" for traffic leaving a local network.

### Routers and Switches

Understanding how switches facilitate communication within a LAN and how routers connect different networks via routing tables.

### OSI layers

Understanding the 7 layers of networking, specifically focusing on the Network (Layer 3) and Data Link (Layer 2) layers.

## Use of AI

AI (e.g., ChatGPT/Gemini) was utilized in the following ways during this project:

- Task: Explaining CIDR to Subnet Mask conversions.

- Task: Troubleshooting routing table logic for complex levels involving multiple routers.

- Parts of Project: Primarily used as a conceptual tutor for the "Resources" section and for verifying the mathematical logic of subnetting.
