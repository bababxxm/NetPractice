# NetPractice

## Description

NetPractice is a 42 school project designed to introduce and reinforce fundamental computer networking concepts through hands-on practice. The project consists of a series of interactive networking puzzles with increasing levels of difficulty.

The primary goal is to correctly configure small-scale network topologies by assigning IP addresses, defining subnet masks, and configuring routing so that all devices can communicate successfully. Through these exercises, the project builds a practical understanding of how data flows across local and interconnected networks.

## Instructions

### Running the Training Interface

NetPractice does not require compilation or installation.

To start the training interface:

1. Download `net_practice.1.8.tgz` to your local machine.
2. Locate the `index.html` file in the project directory.
3. Open `index.html` using any modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
4. Solve each networking level by configuring the network elements until all connections are valid.

---

### Exporting Configurations

Each level must be exported individually after it is successfully completed.

To export a configuration:

1. Complete a level until the interface confirms it is valid.
2. Use the **export** option provided by the NetPractice interface.
3. Save the generated configuration file.
4. Repeat this process for all 10 levels.

---

### Submission Requirements

- You must export **10 configuration files**, one for each level.
- All exported files must be placed **at the root of the Git repository**.
- Filenames must follow the default naming convention provided by the interface (e.g., `level_1.conf`, `level_2.conf`, …, `level_10.conf`).

## Resources

This project required studying and applying the following networking concepts:

### TCP/IP Addressing

Understanding IPv4 addressing, network and host portions, and address allocation.

### Subnet Mask

Using subnet masks and CIDR notation to define network size and boundaries.

### Default Gateway

Configuring the gateway used by hosts to communicate outside their local network.

### Routers and Switches

Understanding how switches operate within a LAN and how routers connect multiple networks using routing logic.

### OSI Layers

Studying the OSI model, with emphasis on:

- Layer 2: Data Link
- Layer 3: Network

---

### Use of Artificial Intelligence

AI tools were used as a **learning and support resource only**. Specifically, AI was used to:

- Clarify networking concepts such as subnetting, routing, and IP addressing
- Verify understanding of theoretical concepts related to the OSI model
- Improve documentation clarity and structure

All network configurations, problem solving, and exported solutions were completed manually by the author.

## Notes

This project focuses on conceptual understanding rather than implementation. No programming language, compilation step, or external dependencies are required.
